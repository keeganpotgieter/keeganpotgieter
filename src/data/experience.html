    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
    Software Developer Intern @ University of Illinois – Urbana Champaign │
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ •
    Created train, and fine-tuned transformer-based language model and OpenAI
    GPT-3 to write and grade papers according to a given rubric. Our model
    graded unseen papers with a 93% accuracy. • Pre-processed and standardized
    training data from various essay sources to enhance model performance. •
    Developed an interactive frontend interface using React to visualize the
    results of the assessment and generation models.
    ┌────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Software Developer @ Ernst & Young
    │ └────────────────────────────────────┘ • Commissioned by Ernst & Young, to
    research and develop novel stock options pricing methods using Quantum
    Computing. • Implemented state of the art options pricing models such as
    Black Scholes and Monte Carlo simulations for quantum computing using
    Qiskit. Researched the effectiveness of Quantum Generative Adversarial
    Networks (QGANs) for options pricing accuracy and developed a Quantum
    Finance API for future development. • Packaged our models into an API for
    future development.
    ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Software
    Engineering & Machine Learning Intern @ NE Quest │
    └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ • Programmed a
    Machine Learning pipeline using TensorFlow and OpenCV to calculate the
    likelihood of diseases in observed patients. Cleaned and normalized data
    collected through experimental testing on patients to be used for creating
    the model. • Digitized an algorithm in Python for the neurological Clock and
    Spiral test used by doctors to detect dementia in patients. My algorithm is
    currently deployed on the NE Quest app on the app store. • Designed and
    programmed a front-end using React for intuitive interaction with the
    neurological test. ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Big Data
    Intern @ Algoscale Technologies │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────┘ • Translated the framework of
    Big Data projects from Apache Storm to Apache Spark increasing server
    efficiency and improving fault tolerance for moving into production. •
    Ensured that all projects interacted smoothly with HBase, Hadoop and Apache
    Zookeeper after translation. • Completed training in Machine/Deep Learning
    Theory and Big Data Technologies.
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │ Deep Learning Researcher @
    Emory University │
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10691" target="_blank"><u>Arxiv</u></a>
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘ • Create a Generative
    Adversarial Network that can produce images of cancerous tissue for further
    research on rare cancers. • Researched the effectiveness of augmenting
    datasets of rare cancers using Generative Adversarial Networks for tumor
    detection. • Designed and implemented a deep learning pipeline using
    TensorFlow on Google Cloud Services to produce microscale images of
    cancerous tissue for increasing size of Cancer Datasets. My model improved
    interpretation of rare cancer types by 73%.
